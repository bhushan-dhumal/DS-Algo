Difference| DFS    | BFS |
| -----------| ----------- | ----------- |
|Traversal| we go **DEEP** down branch and come back      | we go **WIDE**      |
|For Trees | Inorder, preorder,postorder   | level order        |
|Searching |DFS is better when element to be searched is **far** from root element|BFS is better when element to be searched is **near** to starting point|
|Data Structure used to implement |Stack|Queue|
|When to use|Backtracking|shortest distance|


# Complexity for both is same -  

When adjecency Matrix is used  : O(v*v)

When adjecency List is used : O(v+e)

# Space complexity (For stack/ queue) : O(v)
