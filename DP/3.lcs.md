Below solution tried on GFG practice.
Solution gave current output for two examples given but not accepted as it is taking more time.
``` c++
class Solution
{
    public:
    //Function to find the length of longest common subsequence in two strings.
    int lcs(int x, int y, string s1, string s2)
    {
        // your code here
        if(x == 0 || y == 0)
            return 0;
        if(s1[x-1] == s2[y-1])
            return 1+lcs(x-1,y-1,s1,s2);
        return max(lcs(x,y-1,s1,s2),lcs(x-1,y,s1,s2));
    }
};

```
