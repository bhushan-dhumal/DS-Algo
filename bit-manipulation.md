# XOR

    XOR of zero and a bit results in that bit

    0⊕x=x

    XOR of one and a bit flips that bit

    1⊕x=1−x


# Right and left Shift (>>/<<):
Left shift multiplies a number by 2 whereas right shift divides it by 2. 

These are called left/right shift operations as they shift the numbers when represented in their binary format to left/right. 

Eg.
19 : 10011
(19>>2) : 100
This divides 19 by 4.
