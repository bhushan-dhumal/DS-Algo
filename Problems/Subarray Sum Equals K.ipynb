Whenver the sumsum equals the required kk value, we can update the countcount value. We do so while iterating over all the endend indices possible for every startstart index.

    "The idea behind this approach is as follows: If the cumulative sum(repreesnted by sum[i] for sum upto i th index) upto two indices is the same, the sum of the elements lying in between those indices is zero. Extending the same thought further, if the cumulative sum upto two indices, say i and j is at a difference of k i.e. if sum[i] - sum[j] = k, the sum of elements lying between indices i and j is k.\n",

    "We traverse over the array nums and keep on finding the cumulative sum. Every time we encounter a new sum, we make a new entry in the hashmap corresponding to that sum. If the same sum occurs again, we increment the count corresponding to that sum in the hashmap. Further, for every sum encountered, we also determine the number of times the sum sum-k has occured already, since it will determine the number of times a subarray with sum k has occured upto the current index. We increment the countcount by the same amount.\n",
